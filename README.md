PDML to Peach Pit
=================

This is a simple tool to generate Data Models of the Peach Fuzzer from network data captured by popular network sniffers such as Wireshark. The tool takes a PDML file as input and generates an (almost) ready to use Peach Data Model XML.

PDML files are XML files representing the packet structures generated by the dissectors of Wireshark. PDML files can be easily generated by tshark like this:

```
cat single_packet.pcap | tshark -T pdml -i - > packet.pqml
```
